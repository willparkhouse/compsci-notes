A few examples of some optimization applications:

Hill climbing
	-Applicable to any optimization problem
	-Simple algorithm
	-Success dependant on shape of the objective function
	-Good at finding local optima
	-More suited towards discrete optimization problem

An example application of hill-climbing is software module clustering - a form of automated refactoring software, making software easier to develop on and maintain

Simulated Annealing 
	-Also applicable to any optimization problem
	-Need for defining a neighbourhood operator can make it more suited to discrete optimization problems
	-Some problems are more suited towards simulated annealing, itâ€™s impossible to know how well it will work beforehand.

An example application of simulated annealing is VLSI design (think of carpetwrong), placement of transistors and module on a IC, (objectives: minimize area, wiring and congestion // constraints: no clipping, specified area, spread heat dissipation uniformly.
