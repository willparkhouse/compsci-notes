**What is supervised learning?**
Teach a computer to do something, then let it use its knowledge to do it
Other forms of ML include unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.

*Example Uses* could be spam detection or stock price prediction. Spam detection is a **classification** problem, 2 possible output values, spam or not spam. Stock price prediction is a **regression** problem, the output is a real value.

In supervised learning, we give some input, x, and predict an appropriate output, y. We desire a function $f$ such that $f(x) = y$, given that we have example training data in the form (x, y), (x, y)....

The notation we will use in this module $𝑥^{(𝑖)} = (𝑥_1^{(𝑖)}, 𝑥_2^{(𝑖)}, 𝑥_2^{(𝑖)}, … , 𝑥_𝑑^{(𝑖)})$, where $x^{(i)}$ is a vector of all the attributes for the i-th example.

**Workflow of Supervised Learning**

We first train, passing $(x^1,y^1), (x^2,y^2), ..., (x^n,y^n)$ into our algorithm (these are example input / output vectors of what we wish to predict). 

We then test, by passing in a new input vector, x, and check the output vector y.

*Examples of each type of problem*

**Terminology** 
Input == Attributes == Features == Independent Variable
Output == Target == Response == Dependant Variable
Function == Hypothesis == Predictor


We must make sure that we are not overfitting or underfitting - overfitting happens when the model is more complex than required, underfitting happens when the model is simpler than required.
