Example: Suppose we have a pile of biased coins that have two possible biases of $θ_{0.9} = 0.9$ and $θ_{0.1} = 0.1$. 

The probability of a coin have the bias $θ_{0.9}$ is $p(θ_{0.9}) = c$

Lets say we choose a random coin from the pile and toss it, then we replace the coin in the pile. We repeat this many times, to obtain a probability that the coin will land heads up, which is $p(x_h) = a$ 

Then we choose a coin from the pile that we know has a bias of $θ_{0.9}$, the probability of tossing heading with this coin is $p(x_h|θ_{0.9}) = d$

How can we derive the posterior probability $p(θ_{0.9}|x_h)$, that is, the probability of our coin having a bias of $θ_{0.9}$ given that we has tossed heads?

The total area of the whole box is 1. The area $a$ of the green disk $A$ represents the probability $p(x_h)$ that a coin will land with heads, $x_h$. The area $c$ of the pink disk $C$ represents the probability $p(θ_{0.9})$ that a coin has bias $θ = 0.9$. The overlap between $A$ and $C$ is the area $b$, which represents the joint probability $p(x_h, θ_{0.9})$ that a coin will land heads up and that a coin has bias $θ_{0.9}$.
