#### SSL / TLS
The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol was renamed to Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. It provides **encrypted** socket communication and **authentication**, based on public keys. It may use a range of ciphers (RSA, DES, DH, ...).

X.509 certificates contain a subject, subject's public key, issuer name, etc. The **issuer** signs the hash of all the data. To check a certificate, we **hash** all the data and check the **issuers public key**. If I have the issuer's public key and I trust the issuer, I can them be **sure** of the subject's public key.

TLS layer runs between the application and transport layer (TCP). Encryption is transparent to the application.

#### TLS Algorithm

1. $C -> S: N_c$                                             (Client sends nonce to server)
2. $S -> C : N_S, Cert_S$                                  (Server sends new nonce back, and the servers certificate)
3. $C -> S : E_S(K_{seed}), \{Hash_1\}_{K_{CS}}$             (Client sends to server a key seed, encrypted with the server pubkey, and a hash encrypted with the new shared key)
4. $S -> C : \{Hash_2\}_{K_{CS}}$                               (Server sends client a new hash encrypted with the shared key)

$Hash_1 = \#(N_C,N_S,E_S(K_{seed}))$ 
$Hash_2 = \#(N_C,N_S,E_S(K_{seed}), \{Hash_1\}_{K_{CS}})$ 
$K_{CS}$ is a session key based on $N_C, N_S$ and $K_{seed}$. 

Notice in step 3, an attacker could intercept and send their own key seed and hash encrypted with a shared key, BUT in step 4 the client expects to receive a hash encrypted with a key generated from the nonces and the $K_{seed}$ and the attacker cannot get this seed, so the attacker has no way to encrypt the data with the session key that the client generated.

#### TLS-DHE Algorithm

A variant of TLS with Diffie-Hellman exists ensuring forward secrecy.
1. $C -> S: N_c$                                                            (Client sends nonce to server)
2. $S -> C : N_S, g^x, Cert_S, Sign_S(\#(N_C,N_S,g^x))$       (Server sends new nonce back, $g^x$, the servers certificate and a signed hash)
3. $C -> S : g^y, \{\#(All\: previous\: messages\}_{K_{CS}}$           (Client sends to server $g^y$, and a hash of all previous messages encrypted with the session key)
4. $S -> C : \{\#(All\: previous\: messages\}_{K_{CS}}$                (Server sends client a hash of all previous messages encrypted with the session key)

$K_{CS}$ is a session key based on $N_C, N_S$ and $g^{xy}$. 

#### Cipher Suites
At the start of a connection, say between a server and a browser, each communicate which suites they support, and they agreed upon a single suite to use - this is the **cipher suite handshake**. Some cipher suites offer **both** encryption and authentication, others only encryption, others only authentication. 
#### TLS Weaknesses
- A cipher downgrading attack is when an attacker intercepts a the list of preferred suites sent to the server, and forces a less secure suite to be used. 
- Self-signed certificates - maintaining a set of certificates is hard (especially on apps and IoT devices), it’s much easier just to accept any certificate (or certificates that sign themselves). If the client accepts the self-signed certificates, then it’s easy to man-inthe-middle.
- LogJam attack - NSA were MITMing TLS, researchers found a weak Diffie Hellman key is compatible with a strong Diffie Hellman key!
- HeartBleed - programming error in OpenSSL, TLS client can request a “heart beat” from the server to make sure the connection is still open. This memory could contain the server’s key.

#### TLS 1.3 
TLS 1.3 is the newest standard, ratified in 2018, it:
- removes obsolete cryptographic protocols
- simplifies handshaking
- makes forward secrecy mandatory. 

Intercepting TLS connections now only possible as active attacker performing MITM, not by decrypted previously communicated messages.

#### VPN 
An internet connection reveals your IP number. Connection made via their servers, the intended recipient server never see’s your IP address.
To get some anonymity, you can route all your traffic via the VPN. 
- Server thinks you are the VPN provider 
- ISP only sees the connection to the VPN
- A global observer can probably link your connections.
The VPN provider knows both your IP and the destination IP, so there is **no anonymity** to the VPN provided - if we are trying to prevent governments seeing our destination, then we must ensure that the VPN provider is not working with the government, this is hard to confirm and is based on the user trusting the VPN provider.
#### Onion Routing
You get the best anonymity by routing your traffic via a number of proxies. **Onion Routing** ensures that your message really is routed via the proxies you want. Each proxy only learns the IP of the proxy before it and the proxy after it, and the public key of each proxy is known.

The source IP is visible to the first node, destination IP is visible to the last node. The user picks 3 proxies (entry, middle, and exit node) and is anonymous as long as they aren’t all corrupt.

At each stage the node decrypts one layer (hence the name Onion), and sends it forward.
