   	<p>Sensible Furniture saw its sales decline over the last year. This follows a general trend, observable in the whole furniture industry.</p>
	<p>'Our company has been barely making any profits, we have had to make cuts in term of personnel and logistics expenditure, in order to keep afloat. Yes, the sales have been down compared to 2015, with a small improvement in November and December, due to the holidays shopping. But we are optimistic, and exploring new ways of making the company profitable again. We are testing some new products. We are trying to expand in other domains as well. I am confident we will be successful.', said Jak Kinkade, CEO of Sensible Furniture.</p>
	<p>We're all looking forward to seeing their new products and closely follow the evolution of this innovative company.</p>
