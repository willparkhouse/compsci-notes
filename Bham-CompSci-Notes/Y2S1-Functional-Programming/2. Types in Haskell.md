**Type Inference**
All valid expressions in Haskell have types. Functions also have **function types**. For example:
```haskell
Prelude> :type False
False :: Bool
Prelude> :type True
True :: Bool
-- :: reads as 'has type'

Prelude> :type not
not :: Bool -> Bool //function type

-- When applying an argument to a function of suitable type, the output type is the obvious one:
Prelude> :type not False
not False :: Bool

We can also confirm that a given expression has a given type:
Prelude> :type False :: Bool
False :: Bool :: Bool
Prelude> :type not False :: Bool
not False :: Bool :: Bool
```
When writing programs in Haskell, it is much safer to indicate to Haskell which type we expect an expression to have (and have Haskell confirm that type), than to have Haskell figure out the type of the functions we are writing.

**Types**
Haskell has various base types:
1. `Bool` - the type of Booleans
2. `Char` - the type of characters
3. `Int` - fixed-precision integers (between -(2^63) and (2^63)-1); be aware of buffer overflows!
4. `Integer` - arbitrary-precision integers    
5. `Float` - numbers with decimal point
6. `Double` - similar to floats, but more precision

**Composite Types**
We can form complicated types from simpler ones:
1. If `a` is a type, then `[a]` is the type of lists of values in `a`.
2. If `a` and `b` are types, then `(a,b)` is the type of pairs of a value in `a` and a value in `b`.
3. Generalizing the above point, we also can build triples `(a, b, c)`, quadruples `(a, b, c, d)`, etc.
4. If `a` and `b` are types, then `a -> b` is the type of functions from `a` to `b`.

**Curried functions**
Consider the function:
```haskell
add :: (Integer, Integer) -> Integer
add (x,y) = x + y
```
Since a function can also return a function, we can instead write this function as follows:
```haskell
add' :: Integer -> (Integer -> Integer)
add' x y = x + y
```

-This is the same principle as the fact that proving `A → B → C` is the same as proving `A ∧ B → C` in propositional logic!
-The parentheses in `Integer -> (Integer -> Integer)` are not necessary; we write `Integer -> Integer -> Integer` instead.
-Similarly, `add' x y` actually means `(add' x) y`, which reads "add x applied to y"; again the parentheses are not needed. (But they are needed when we want to write something like `f (g x)`).

This principle generalizes to functions with more than two arguments:
```haskell
add3 :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer -> Integer
add3 x y z = x + y + z
```
