### FUNCTION LIST

`x:xs` appends element `x` to the front of list `xs`

`concat` takes a list of lists and concatenates them

`zip [a] [b]` makes list `[(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ... (an, bn)]` where `n` is the smallest of `length [a]` and `length [b]`

`unzip [(a,b)]` makes a pair of lists `([a], [b])`

`==` takes `a` and `a` and returns `Bool` if `a` in type class EQ

`&&` takes `a` and `a` and returns `Bool` if `a` is of type bool

`sum` takes `[a] -> a` returns sum of list, e.g. `sum [1,2,3,4]` =  `10`

`quot` takes `Integral a => a -> a -> a` and does `a div a`, discarding remainder

`length` takes `[a] -> Int` and returns the number of items in the list

`map` takes `(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]` and returns a list constructed by applying the function to all items in the list, e.g. `map reverse ["abc","cda","1234"]` = `["cba","adc","4321"]` // `map (3*) [1,2,3,4]` = `[3,6,9,12]`

`filter` takes `(a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]`, and returns a list constructed from members of the list, fulfilling a condition, e.g. `filter (>5) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]` = `[6,7,8]`

`drop` takes `Int -> [a] -> [a]` and returns the list after the first `Int` elements, e.g. `drop 5 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` = `[6,7,8,9,10]`

`dropWhile` takes `(a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]`, and inspects the original list and takes from it its elements from the moment when the condition fails for the first time till the end of the list, e.g. `dropWhile (<3) [1,2,3,4,5]` = `[3,4,5]`, `dropWhile even [2,4,6,7,9,11,12,13,14]` = `[7,9,11,12,13,14]`

`take` takes `Int -> [a] -> [a]`, and returns the first `Int` members of the `[a]` argument, e.g. `take 5 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`= `[1,2,3,4,5]`

`takeWhile` takes `(a->Bool) -> [a] -> [a]`, and returns the elements of the list while 
`a->Bool` is `True`, and otherwise then stop processing, e.g: `takeWhile (<3) [1,2,3,4,5]` = `[1,2]` // `takeWhile (>3) [1,2,3,4,5]` = `[]` // `takeWhile odd [1,3,5,7,9,10,11,13,15,17]` = `[1,3,5,7,9]`

`splitAt` takes `Int -> [a] -> ([a],[a])` and splits the list at the `Int` index, e.g. `splitAt 5 [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` = `([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10])`

`reverse` reverses a list

`replicate` takes `Int -> a -> [a]`, and creates a list of length `Int` of elements of `a`, e.g. `replicate 3 5` = `[5,5,5]`

`head` takes `[a]` and returns the first element

`tail` takes `[a]` and returns all except first element

`last` takes `[a]` and returns the last element

`init` takes `[a]` and returns all except last element

`elem` takes `a` and `[a]` and returns `True` if list contains an item equal to the argument

`any` takes a `(a->Bool)` and `[a]` and returns True if at least one item in the list fulfils the condition, eg. `any (1==) [0,1,2,3,4,5]` = True, `any (>5) [0,1,2,3,4,5]` = False

`all` takes a `(a->Bool)` and `[a]` and returns True if all items in the list fulfil the condition, e.g. `all (<10) [1,3,5,7,9]` = True, `all (==1) [1,1,0,1,1]` = False

`words` takes `String -> [String]` and creates an array of string from the original one, white space characters serving as separators, e.g. `words "hello world"` = `["hello","world"]

`until` takes `(a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> a -> a`, and applies the function in the second argument to the third argument, and it compares the result with the condition, if the condition evaluates to True, it prints the result, if not, it passes the result to the function and repeats the cycle as long as the condition is matched. e.g. `until (> 100) (*2) 1` = `128`

`cycle` takes `[a] -> [a]` and it creates a circular list from a finite one, e.g. `take 10 (cycle [1,2,3])` = `[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1]`
