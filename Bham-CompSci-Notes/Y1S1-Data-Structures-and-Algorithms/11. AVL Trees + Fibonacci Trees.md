BST's can be very unbalanced (completely asymmetrical), and this makes operations on them of O(n) cost, versus a perfectly balanced BST which has cost O(log2(N)).
We can use an **AVL** tree data structure to prevent this unbalancing. 

The **height** of a **node** (NOT root) is the length of the longest path from that node to a leaf node (so node to the lowest point).
The **balance** of a node is: the height of the left subtree - the height of the right subtree

Definition: A **BST** is said to be an **AVL** when the balance at EVERY node is either -1, 0 or 1

***Perfectly Balanced Trees***

A **perfectly balanced tree** is an AVL with **maximal** nodes for its height, and balance 0 throughout. Every node, except leaf nodes, have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are on the same level.

If a tree is **perfectly balanced**, then the number of nodes is: 2^(height + 1) - 1

***Fibonacci Trees***

A **Fibonacci tree** is an AVL which has the **minimal** nodes for its height, and the highest imbalance that an AVL can have.

A Fibonacci tree's subtrees are *also* Fibonacci trees, one of which has height one greater than the other (as shown above)

There are **two** minimal AVL trees of **height 1**, and **four** minimal AVL trees of **height 2**. These trees are all the same, except for the ordering of children. Minimal AVL tree's of a given height all have the same size. 
We can make a tree of height h by combining the trees of height h-1 and h-2, like:

SO the size of a minimal AVL tree $T_{h}$ is 1 + $T_{h-2}$ + $T_{h-1}$, OR you can calculate using the Fibonacci numbers using $T_{h}$ + 1 = $F_{h+3}$, where F is the Fibonacci number.

The height h is at least $(log_{2} n)-1$.

**AVL Tree Operations**
In an AVL tree, search, insert and delete is all of O(log n).
	-Searching is the same as with a BST
	-Insert using BST insert, then check balance and fix if required
	-Delete using BST delete, then check balance and fix if required

After inserting or deleting, we re-balance using a **rotation**.

See below a GIF of a left rotation.

There are **4 cases** of **imbalance** after an insert, as shown below. After inserting, we traverse up from the insertion point and check the balance of each of the parent nodes, up to the root. If we find an imbalanced node we rotate from here. The 4 different imbalance cases are shown below:

![[chrome_oJxGrr8VbR.png]]
Z is the subtree where the new node was inserted, and X is where the balance invariant is unmet.

For the **LL** and **RR** cases we simply use a Right and Left rotation respectively, 
For **LR** and **RL**, we must first rotate the Y-subtree, then the X tree. 
In the case of **LR**, we rotate Y **left**, then X **right**.
In the case of **RL**, we rotate Y **right**, then X **left**.
