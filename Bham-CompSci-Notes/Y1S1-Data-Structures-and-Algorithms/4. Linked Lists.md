 **Linked List**
A linked list is constructed from structures called nodes. These nodes have a value variable (to hold the value) and one or more node variables (which contain a pointer to the next node). These nodes are connected to each other in a chain.

```
class Node {
	int val;
	Node next;
}
Node list  = END;
```

The first node in the chain contains only a pointer to the first element.
The last node in the chain contains the last value, and the `'Node'` variable contains `'END'`.
In pseudocode:
the first node is simply `list`, 
the second node's value is `list.val` and the 'Node' or pointer is `list.next`, 
the third node's value is `list.next.val` and the pointer is `list.next.next` and so on.

Diagrammatic view of a linked list:

The above diagram shows a linked list representing the list '7, 3, 6'.

To insert a new node using pseudocode at the beginning of a list, we could:
```
void insertbeg (Node list, int number) {  
newNode = new Node ();  
newNode.val = number  
newNode.next = list;  
list = newNode ;  
}
```
This process is computationally cheap as all we have to do is replace the `list` node's pointer to the new address and point to the original first value containing node.

Linked lists are useful if we want to perform operations that remove a single element from within the center of the list. If we wanted to make a queue, we could implement an array, but this means that every time an entry is removed the entire array after that entry requires editing, which is very computationally expensive. Whereas linked lists require minimal computation as all is required is to replace the previous entries' pointer to the next entry.

```
void delete_begin(Node list){
	if list == END {
		throw new EmptyListException(”delete_begin”);  
	}  
	list = list.next;  
}
```
What delete_begin does: (deletes first entry)

What delete_end does:

delete_end pseudocode:
`cursor = list`
`while(cursor.next.next != END
	`cursor = cursor.next
	`cursor.next = END`
