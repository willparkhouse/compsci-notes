We've looked a few different types of TMs: for example, one that takes words and returns words, or one that takes a language, and word, and returns true/false. If it of the latter type, we say the machine **decides** the language.

The complexity class P is the set of all languages that can be decided by polytime machine.

P and NP and EXP are classes for DECISION PROBLEMS. 

PRIMES is the set of all bitstrings that represented (in binary) are prime numbers.
Theorem PRIMES $\in$ P
	This means that given a prime k

We have a complexity class EXP, which contains all complexities of the form O($x^n$), we specify it as $2^{n^k}$, which is equivalent to any $x^n$ value. 

We've only considered words previously, but we can work on many different types of data: strings, objects , java programs, graphs... We first need to convert these datatypes into words, but there are many ways to encode a graph into a word, for example - different encodings cause certain problems to be in the class of P and other encodings to solve the same problem might be EXP, BUT we can convert between encodings in polytime, so this is less relevant.

P $\Subset$ NP $\Subset$ EXP
P = NP? This is unknown.

**Non-deterministic TM**

A **non-deterministic turing machine** (NDTM) introduces a step called "**choose**", which can randomly choose whether to go one way or another. Given a word *w*, we start the machine with just *w* on the tape and the head on the leftmost character. The work is **acceptable** if the machine *may* return true, and unacceptable otherwise.

The set ***L*** of acceptable words is the language of the machine. 

A **NDTM** is polynomial time if there's M and C and *k* such that, for every word *w* of size n $\geq$ M, when the machine starts with just *w* on the tape and the head on the leftmost character, the machine is guaranteed to terminate in time at most $C* n^k$, regardless of the choices made.

The complexity class NP is the set of all languages that are given by a polytime NDTM. Since a TM is also a NDTM, we can see that P $\Subset$ NP. It's also the case that P $\Subset$ EXP. 

To see this, suppose we have a NDTM that runs in time $C* n^k$, for large enough n. Then to check all possible choices will take at most $2^{C*n^k}*C*n^k$ steps, which is exponential.

Is it the case that P = NP ? That is, can we convert a polytime nondeterministic machine M into a polytime deterministic machine N with the same language? Meaning that a word will be accepted by N iff it is acceptable to M. --- This is unproven either way, but it is assumed that P $\neq$ NP.

**Sudoku Example**

Consider an n x n sudoku game, we have three different computational problems:
	-The sudoku **checking problem** - given a puzzle and a candidate solution, check whether the solution is correct, this is a decision problem.
	-The sudoku **solvability problem** - given a puzzle, decide whether it's solvable, this is a decision problem.
	-The sudoku **solution problem** - given a puzzle, find a solution, or return impossible, this is NOT a decision problem.

The checking problem is in P. To check a candidate solution, we first check the rows, then check the columns, and finally check the subgrids. Each row has $n^2$ entries, which we each check against every other, giving $n^4$ comparisons. There are $n^2$ rows, so checking all of them is $n^2 * n^4 = n^6$ comparisons. The same applies for columns and subgrids. So we have O($n^6$) comparisons. The time taken for each comparison is proportional to the length of the numbers, so it is O($log n$), giving us O($n^6 log n$) steps, which is O($n^7$) steps.

The solvability problem is in EXP - given a problem we can consider all possible candidate solutions and check them each in polytime. This is also in NP - given a puzzle, we guess the solution's bit by bit, which takes polynomially many steps, then check it, which takes polynomially many steps. It's unlikely to guess the solutions, BUT there is a way in which is does, so it's acceptable iff it has a solution and in NP. Thus if P = NP, then the sudoku solvability problem can be solved in polynomial time.

The solution problem is not a decision problem at all, but if the solvability problem can be solved in polytime, so can the search problem - again only if P = NP.

One way to think about this concept - imagine we have an oracle that tells us in 1 step whether something is solvable or not. We first ask if it's solvable, then randomly place a number somewhere, then ask again - if yes, we continue, otherwise go back one step and repeat this. This means that the problem can be solved in at most $n^2*log(n)*n^4$ steps, and is polytime. 

SO if there is a polytime algorithm for answering solvability, then there is a polytime algorithm for finding solution, for all decision problems.

**Hamiltonian Paths**
Given a directed graph, a hamiltonian path from vertex s to vertex t is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. We have three problems:
	-The Hamiltonian path **checking problem**: given a graph with designated s and t, and a path from s to t, say whether itâ€™s Hamiltonian.
	-The Hamiltonian path **existence problem**: Given a graph with designated s and t, is there a Hamiltonian path?
	-The Hamiltonian path **search problem**: given a graph with designated s and t, find a Hamiltonian path, or return Impossible.

The checking problem is in P. The existence problem is in NP, since we can guess the path, and its length is linear in the input size. The search is not a decision problem, but if the existence problem is in P, then the search problem can be solved in polytime, filling the path solution node-by-node.

**SAT Problem**
The SAT problem's goal is to determine propositional satisfiability. We have atoms and connectives, and assignments.

The **formula SAT assignment** checking problem - given a formula and an assignment, say whether it's a satisfying assignment. 
The **formula-SAT problem** - given a formula, say whether it's satisfiable.
The **formula satisfying assignment search problem** - given a formula, find a satisfying assignment, or return *impossible*.

*Example formulas*
Are the above examples satisfiable? 

The checking problem can be performed in linear time, using an algorithm called "shunting yard". The size of a candidate assignment is linear in the size of the formula, therefore formula-SAT is in NP because we can guess an assignment, which takes linear time.
The search problem can be solved in polytime IFF P=NP.

**Another Definition of NP**
First definition: L $\in$ NP when it's a language of a polytime NDTM.
New definition:
L $\in$ NP when there exists polynomial P and polytime machine N, such that the following are equivalent for any word *w*: 

w $\in$ L IFF $\exists$ x of length p(|w|) such that when we put w and x into N, the machine accepts the pair <w,x>.

If we try to relate this to the sudoku example, w is the puzzle, L is the set of solvable sudoku puzzle, x is the solution. 

If L $\in$ NP according to our new definition, then there's a polytime NDTM that guess and check the certificate in polynomial time. Vice versa, if L $\in$ NP according to definition 1, then there's a polytime NDTM, where the number of steps $\leq$ P(n), where P is some polynomial. The **certificate** is a sequence of choices $\leq$ P(n) in length. 

**Completeness** 
Let L and L' be languages. A **reduction** from L to L' is a function $f: \Sigma * \implies \Sigma *$ such that for any bitstring $x$, we have $x \in L$ IFF $f(x) \in L'$. When this is done on a polytime machine, it's a **polytime reduction**.

The idea is that if we know how to decide membership of L', then the reduction gives us a way to decide membership of L. If we have a polytime reduction from L to L', and L' $\in$ P, then L $\in$ P. A language is said to be **NP-hard** when every language in NP reduces to it in polytime. It is **NP-complete** when it is **in NP** and also **NP-hard**. The problems we looked at earlier, **sudoku**, **SAT** and **hamiltonian pathing**, are all **NP-complete**.
