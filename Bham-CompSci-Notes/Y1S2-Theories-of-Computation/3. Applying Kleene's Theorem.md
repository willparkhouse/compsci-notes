**Which languages are regular?**
All languages that are the language of a regex.

If **L** is a **regular language**, what about **L compliment**? Yes, this is shown in the image below - **complements** can be **represented as a DFA**, with the accepting / rejecting states **reversed**.

The compliment of a regular language is regular:

The **union** and **intersection** of **two regular** languages is **also regular**.

**Language Equivalence** 
We can **test whether two DFA's are equivalent**: Start at the initial state of each automaton. If **one** is **accepting** and the **other** **rejects**, then the automata are **not** language **equivalent** (since one accepts ε and the other doesn’t). If they **both accept** or **both reject** then see what pair of states we transition to by inputting a, and what pair by inputting b. And we carry on forever.
