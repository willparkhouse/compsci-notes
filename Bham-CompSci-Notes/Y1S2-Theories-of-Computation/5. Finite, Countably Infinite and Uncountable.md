Every set is either finite or infinite. Every finite set has a cardinality (size), which is a natural number. 

Examples of finite sets:
• The empty set. This has cardinality 0. 
• The set of all modules in the CS first year. This has cardinality 6. 
• The set {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17.19} of all prime numbers less than 20. This has cardinality 8. 
• Any subset of a finite set. 

Examples of infinite sets: 
• The set N of all natural numbers. 
• The set Z of all integers. 
• The set Q of all rational numbers. 
• The set R of all real numbers. 
• The set of all prime numbers. 
• The set {0, 1, 2} ∗ of all words in the alphabet {0, 1, 2}. 
• The set PN of all sets of natural numbers. 
• The set P({0, 1, 2} ∗ ) of all languages in the alphabet {0, 1, 2}.

A set A is **countably infinite** when there's a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between $\mathbb{N}$ and A

The set of all prime number is countably infinite:

More generally **any** infinite subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is countably infinite.

The set $\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers is countably infinite:

The set of $\mathbb{N}$ X $\mathbb{N}$ of all ordered pairs of natural numbers is countably infinite:

The set {0, 1}* is countably infinite, because these words can be enumerated through:

Likewise, A* is countably infinite, for any finite set A with at least one element.
