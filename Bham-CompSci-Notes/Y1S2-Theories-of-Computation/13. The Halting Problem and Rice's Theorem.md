We can see that there are undecidable problems, because there are countably many turing machines but uncountably many decision problems. So some decision problems are undecidable -> some functions Nat -> Nat.

We're going to looking at the **halting problem**, which was the first discovered undecidable problem:
Given a nullary program (one that takes no arguments), say whether it halts or not. This is difficult, because how can we know if the program is hanging or just halfway to a solution, then halts. A goog example of why this is impossible is Goldbach’s conjecture—the statement that every even number > 4 is a sum of two primes. It is currently unknown whether this is true or false, but we can program it very simply.

We now consider whether it is possible to have a machine that can check whether a problem halts or not, called "the halting tester". Turing proved that the halting problem is undecidable, i.e. there is no such tester. Here is the proof:

Suppose it is decidable:
1.Consider a unary halting problem, that takes a unary problem and a single argument - 
`void f (String x){...`
We can represnt this a a nullary method, g, by taking the code of f and replacing x wit argument. Then g termintates when f terminates on arugment y and vice versa.
