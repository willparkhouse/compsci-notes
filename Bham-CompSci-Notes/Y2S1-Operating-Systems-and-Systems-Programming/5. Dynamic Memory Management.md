Consider an application where the volume of data is not known beforehand 
Example: Store info of the people you meet during office hour:
• The number of people is not known.
• Each person may provide different amount of info.

We could allocate a large array, but this may be wasteful, may be insufficient, and tiny computes can't afford large amount of space. Instead of allocating an arbitrarily sized array, we could allocate memory at runtime as per demand.

C provides dynamic memory management functions in `stdlib.h`, `malloc()`:
1. Allocates requested number of bytes of **contiguous** memory from the **Heap**. 
2. Returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated space. 
3. If memory allocation fails, then `malloc()` returns `NULL` pointer.

```c
//Example: Allocate space for 3 int 
int *p; 

//directly type size of datatype
p = (int *) malloc(3*4); // int is 4 bytes

//could instead use sizeof()
p = (int *) malloc(3*sizeof(int));

//but malloc() could fail at memory allocation so instead:
if((p= (int *) malloc(3*sizeof(int)))==NULL){ 
	printf("Allocation failed"); 
	exit(-1); 

//Dynamically allocated block of memory can be released using free().
free(p);
}
```

If memory allocated using `malloc()` is not `free()`-ed, then the system will “leak memory”. Block of memory is allocated, but not returned to Heap. The program therefore grows larger over time. In C, it is your responsibility to prevent memory leak

There are tools to detect memory leaks, we will use valgrind. First the code must be compiled using gcc, then `valgrind --leak-check=full ./a.out`.

#### Cautions
- After `free(p)`, the memory is no longer owned by the program. Re-accessing the memory pointed by `p` causes undefined behaviour. 
- Don’t free something that did not come from `malloc()`.
- **Double free** errors occur when free() is called more than once with the same memory address as an argument. When free() is called twice with the same argument, the program’s memory management data structures become corrupted. Every time free() is called, the address is added to the list of available memory blocks. Since the freed address is present twice in the list, the next two memory allocations will have the same address (which is a problem).
