#### Simplified Structure of Kernel:
- **Boot Time Initialization:**
    - Initialize data structures during boot time.
- **Operational Loop:**
    - While the system is running:
        -Check if the timer has expired.
        -Assign the CPU to a suitable process and execute it.
        -If the timer has expired, select the next suitable process.

### Linux Kernel Programming

#### Kernel's Resource Access and Constraints:

- The kernel has unrestricted access to all resources.
- Kernel programs are not limited by constraints in memory or hardware access.
- Faulty kernel programs can potentially cause system crashes.

#### Interaction Between Kernel and User Programs:

- Kernel functions are exposed only through special functions known as system calls.
- These system calls are provided by the standard C library.
- There exists a strict separation between kernel data and data for user programs, requiring explicit data copying (e.g., `copy_to_user()`, `copy_from_user()`).

#### Interrupts in Kernel:

- The kernel interacts with hardware by using interrupts, which prompt the hardware to perform specific actions.
- Interrupts must be processed swiftly, and any code invoked by interrupts must not sleep.

#### Linux Kernel Modes:

- Two primary modes for kernel code:
    - Process Context: Kernel code executing system calls for user programs.
    - Interrupt Context: Kernel code handling hardware interrupts.
- User data access is only permitted in process context.
- Code running in process context can be preempted by interrupts.
- Interrupts have varying priority levels; higher priority interrupts preempt lower priority ones.

#### Kernel Modules:

- Modules can be added or removed from the running kernel.
- Useful for providing device drivers that are necessary only if the associated hardware is present.
- Functions like `modprobe` (to insert modules), `rmmod` (to remove modules), and `lsmod` (to list running modules) are used for management.

#### Concurrency Issues in the Kernel:

- Proper handling of concurrency is critical, particularly in manipulating shared data structures between process and interrupt modes.
- In multi-processor systems, managing shared data structures across different contexts is essential.

#### Achieving Mutual Exclusion:

- Two methods:
    - **Semaphores/Mutex:** Allow a process to sleep until a critical section is available.
    - **Spinlocks:** Involves repeated attempts to enter a critical section and can lead to busy waiting.

#### Semaphores:

- Two types:
    - Normal semaphores
    - Read-Write semaphores for specific scenarios where critical regions mostly involve reading shared data structures.

#### Data Transfer Between User Space and Kernel:

- Linux employs a directory called `proc` as an interface between user space and the kernel for information exchange.

#### Major Parts of the Linux Kernel:

- Device drivers, file systems, scheduling, process management, memory management, networking code, architecture-specific low-level code, and include files are the main components categorized in different subdirectories.
