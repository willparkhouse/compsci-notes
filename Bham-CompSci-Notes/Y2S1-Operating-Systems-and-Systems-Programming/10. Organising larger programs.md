C-Preprocessor is called before compiler, which does syntactic transformations on code.

```
#include <filename>: insert file into source code 

#define <name> <text>: replace <name> by <text>. 
	Macros may have arguments: #define MAX(A,B) ((A) > (B)) ? (A) : (B)) 

#if <expression> include following text only if <expression> is true 
	Expression must contain only constants #endif and #else delimit the scope 

#defined(<name>) returns 1 if <name> has been declared by #define <name> and 0 otherwise.
```
*Examples of some commands.*

Program may be **split** amongst several files **compile** each file **separately** via 
`gcc -Wall -Werror -c <filename>.c` 
and link them all together with 
`gcc -Wall -Werror -o <filename> <filename1>.o <filename2>.o ..`
If function or variable defined in one file and used in other one, need to have extern declaration of these functions or variables in other file


Often used routines may be assembled into **library**: 
Create object files as usual 
Create library via `gcc -Wall -Werror -shared -fPIC -o lib<library>.so <filename1>.o ..`
