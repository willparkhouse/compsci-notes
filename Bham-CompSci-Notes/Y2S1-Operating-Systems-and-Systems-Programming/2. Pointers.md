In C, the compiler allocates memory for each variable, giving it a unique address. We can access the memory address of a variable by using the `&` operator, like so:
```c
int c, d;
int p*;
c = 5;

p = &c; //p is now the address of c, we say it "points to" c
```

We can use the unary operator `*` on a pointer to access the object the pointer points to:
```c
d = *p //this will assign d to be 5
```

```c
int c = 5, d, e[3]; 
int *p; // Declared pointer p of type int 

p = &c; // p now points to c 
d = *p; // d is now 5 
p = &e[0]; // p now points to e[0]
```

Notice that the [pointer] is declared as `int p*`. Pointers have to have the same datatype as what it's pointing towards. There are implications if a pointer points to a different type:
• int pointer ‘thinks’ the object it is pointing to is int and is of 4 bytes size. 
• char pointer ‘thinks’ the data it is pointing to is char and is of 1 byte size. 
• long long pointer ‘thinks’ the data it is pointing to is long long and is of 8 bytes size. 
• Similar logic for other types … 

Example of incorrect type assignments: `int i = 0xAABBCCDD;`

Never assign an absolute address to a pointer! `int *p = 100; // illegal assignment to pointer`

Pointer variables can appear in expressions. If ‘p’ points to the object ‘x’, then `*p` can occur in any context where x could. Unary operators `*` and `&` have higher precedence than arithmetic operators. 
`*p = *p + 10;` is `(*p) = (*p) + 10;`.

`*p = *p + 1;` is `++*p;`, but `*p = *p + 1;` is not `*p++;`. Prefix `++` and `--` operators have same precedence as unary `*` and `&` Postfix `++` and `--` operators have higher precedence than unary `*` and `&`

If p is a pointer then p++ or p+1, points to the **next object** of the **same type**. So:
	-value of p increments by 4 when p is an int pointer 
	-value of p increments by 4 when p is a float pointer
	-value of p increments by 1 when p is a char pointer
	
**Scale factor** is the number of bytes used by a data-type. To know the scale factor for a data-type, we can use the `sizeof()` function, like `sizeof(int)`.

**HOW DOES SCALEFACTOR WORK FOR USERMADE OBJECTS?**

**Arrays**
	Array is a sequential collection of elements of the same type. Example: `int a[10];` is a block of 10 consecutive objects named `a[0], a[1], ... , a[9]`. The `a[i]` notation refers to the i-th element of the array.

 ```c
int a[10]; 
int *p = &a[0]; 
int b = *p;
``` 
`p` is a pointer to the first element of array a, and `a[0]` is copied into `b`.
**`p+1` points to `a[1]`, `p+i` points to `a[i]`.**

**Using Array Name as an Address**
Array-name is a synonym for the location of the initial element. So:
`int *p = &a[0];` can also be written as `int *p = a;`.
![[Obsidian_7NMLUheGVT.jpg]]
But because an array-name is a constant expression, not a variable, there are some pitfalls:
```c
int a[10]; 
int *p = &a[0]; 
p++; // legal since p is a variable 
p=p+1; // legal 

a++; // illegal since a is not a variable 
a=a+1; // illegal
```

**Pointers to 2D Arrays**
![[Obsidian_wVyLMpQWzO.jpg]]

```c
#define ROW 3 
#define COL 4 
int main(){ 
	int a[ROW][COL] = {{1,2,3,4}, {5,6,7,8}, {9,10,11,12}}; 
	int *p = &a[0][0]; 
	int i; 
	for(i=0; i<ROW*COL; i++) 
		printf("%d\n", *(p+i)); 
	return 0;
}
```
The above code prints the entire 2D array in row-major order.
Notice the line `int *p = &a[0][0];`, this could not be `int *p = a;` because:
For a 1d array `a[]`, the array name is a constant expression whose value is the address of `a[0]`, and `a+i` is the address of `a[i]`, but for a 2d array, the array name is a constant expression whose value is the address of the **0th row**, and `a+i` is the address of the ith row.

A string of characters is a 1D array of chars. ASCII code (1 byte) of each character is stored in consecutive memory locations. String is terminated by the null character `\0`. We can access strings using pointers:
```c
int main(){ 
	char name[ ] = "Comp Sc"; 
	char *ptr = &name[0]; 
	
	// print char-by-char 
	while(*ptr != '\0'){ 
		printf("%c", *ptr);
		ptr++; 
	}
	return 0;
}
```
Instead of initializing by using:
```c
char name[] = "Comp Sc";
char *ptr = &name[0];
``` 
we can initialize directly using:
```c
char *ptr = "Comp Sc";
```
With such a declaration, the string gets stored in the ‘read-only’ section of the program code. Any attempt to modify read-only data will cause ‘segmentation’ fault and the program will crash.
