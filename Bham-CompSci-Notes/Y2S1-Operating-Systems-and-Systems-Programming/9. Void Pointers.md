A void pointer in C has no associated date type. It can store the address of any type of objects. It's also known as a 'generic pointer'. It can be type-casted to any type.
```c
void *pointer_name;
```
An important feature of the void pointer is reusability. We can store the address of **any** object, and whenever required we can typecast it to a required type.

```c
int main() { 
	void *pv; 
	int iData = 5; 
	char cData = 'C'; 
	
	//Pointer to char 
	pv = &cData; 
	
	//Dereferencing void pointer with char typecasting 
	printf("cData = %c\n\n",*((char*)pv)); 
	
	//Pointer to int 
	pv = &iData; 
	
	//Dereferencing void pointer with int typecasting 
	printf("iData = %d\n\n",*((int *)pv)); 
	
	return 0;
}
```
*Void pointer example*

What will be the result of:
```C
int main() { 
	int a[4] = {1, 5, 13, 4};
	void *pv = &a[0]; 
	pv = pv + 1; 
	printf("Value %d\n", *((int *) pv) ); 
	return 0; 
}
```
It won't print 5, as `pv+1` does not increment `pv` by `scale_factor=4`, unless we typecast using:
```c
pv = (int *) pv + 1;
```
If using the above line, the example will print `5`.

**Function Pointer**
We can point to a function - the pointer points to the starting address of the function. The syntax for declaration is `int (*foo)(int);`.

Take care - A function pointer declaration is `int (*foo)(int);`, but a function that returns a pointer of type int is `int *foo(int);`. The brackets are necessary for declaring a function pointer.

```c
void int_func(int a) {
	printf("%d\n", a); 
} 

int main() { 
	void (*foo)(int); 
	
	// Initialization - & is optional 
	foo = &int_func;
	 
	// Function call - two ways
	foo(2); 
	(*foo)(3);
	
	return 0; 
}
```
