Typical memory layout of C program has the following sections: 
1. Text or code segment 
	- Text segment contains the the **program** i.e. the **executable instructions**.
2. Data segments 
	- **Two** data segments contain **initialized** and **uninitialized** **global** and **static variables** respectively.
3. Stack segment 
	- The stack segment is used to store all **local** or **automatic** **variables**. When we pass **arguments** to a function, they are **kept in stack**.
4. Heap segment
	- The heap segment is used to store **dynamically allocated variables** are stored.

^This figure is symbolic. Heap section need not start from the address just after data segment 

**Local variables** **within a function**: scope **is** the function. They are allocated in the stack-frame of the function. After the function call, the **stack-frame is released**. 

**Static variables** are stored in the data segment, not in the stack. The data segment is active during the **entire life-time** of the program. So, **static variables preserve** their values **even after** they are **out of their scope**.

A **global variable** is declared outside all functions. It can be read or updated by **all functions**. Careful: Do not name any local var in the name of a global var.
