 Reminder about mathematical induction:  
**BASIS** 
First step - P true for P(0) or some other number
**INDUCTION**
Second step - Assume true for P(n)
**PROOF**
Third step - Prove true for P(n+1)
Therefore we have proven for all natural number larger than our starting number.


**ADD STUFF TO DO WITH PROOF BY INDUCTION (WEAK/STRONG)**


**Kleene's Theorem**
*For a language L $\subseteq \Sigma$\*, the following are equivalent:
-L can be described by a regex.
-The matching problem for L can be solved by a DFA.*

**From Regex to DFA**
![[chrome_fSpoCdlekg.jpg]]
We see that **for every regex**, E, **there is a DFA** that **recognizes the same language**. This is a course-of-values  
induction on the length of E. In other words, we prove that the statement is true for E assuming that it is true for all  
shorter expressions. All we need to assume is that the property holds for subexpressions. For example, to prove the property for  
E0E1, we need only assume that itâ€™s true for the subexpressions E0 and E1. This kind of argument often appears in  
computer science, and is called **structural induction**.  After we have reduced the regex into one large $\epsilon$NFA, we first remove the epsilons, then determinize as seen before to get to a DFA.

**Generalized NFA**
A generalized NFA is a version of an NFA where each arrow is labelled with a regex.

(*An example of a generalized NFA*)

We can use a **generalized NFA** to **convert** back **into regex** - this occurs in several stages.:

1. **Combine any two arrows** going from **one state** to the **same state** - in the above example $(bc)*c$ and $a|bc$ are combined into $((bc)*c)|(a|bc)$.
2. We **add** a **start** and **end state**, the latter of which becomes the sole accepting state. The **old states** are called ***intermediate***. **Connect start states** to **all other states**, with an epsilon if it was the initial, or a 0 if it wasn't. **Connect all states** to the **end state**, with epsilon if it was an acceptance state, or a 0 if it was a rejection state.
3. We then **remove all *intermediate* states** - by combining like we did in step one, and **when** there are **no more intermediate states**, we can **read off a regex** that's **equivalent to the automaton** we started with.
