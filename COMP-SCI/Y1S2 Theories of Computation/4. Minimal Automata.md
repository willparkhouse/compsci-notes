When we **convert** a **regex into a DFA** or **partial DFA**, we **sometimes obtain** an automaton with **more states than are needed**. We can reduce the number of states systematically to obtain a ***minimal automaton***.

A state s is **reachable** when there is a **path from** an **initial state** to ***s***. 
A state s is **hopeful** when there is a path from ***s*** to an **accepting state**.
Two states *s* and *t* are **equivalent** when the language of *s* (the set of words that are acceptable starting from *s*) is the same as for the language of *t*.

A partial DFA is minimal when it satisfies three condition:
	Every state is **hopeful**.
	Every state is **reachable**.
	Every pair of **equivalent** states are equal. 

There can be **more than one** minimal PDFA for the same language. If M and N are minimal PDFAs for the same language, then there is a unique isomorphism between M and N.

To minimize a PDFA we:
	**Remove all the unreachable states**.
	**Remove all the hopeless states**.
	**Identify each set of equivalent states**.
