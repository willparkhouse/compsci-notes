# Activity Plan for Week 1

This week involves an anticipated time commitment of 12 total hours of structured and self-directed activity, where 3 of them are a lecture and a lab session.

## Module information

 0. Read [Important module information](https://git.cs.bham.ac.uk/fp/fp-learning-2023/-/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

In Week 1 of the Functional Programming module, we will:

 * Have a general overview of the module with the Game of Life as an example

 * Study types.

 * Study polymorphism.

## Activities **before** the in-person lecture

 1. Read handout [Introduction to Haskell - Conway's Game of Life](Life.md).

This is a general overview of Haskell, our functional programming language. In the next few weeks, we will study all the features of Haskell that are mentioned in the handout, one by one.

## Activities **after** the in-person lecture

This can be during the lab session.

 2. Read handout - [Types in Haskell](types.md)

 3. Read handout - [Polymorphism](polymorphism.md)

## Lab Session: how to prepare

 4. Check which lab session you have been allocated to in your timetable.

The first lab session doesn't require any preparation, but here is the problem sheet we will use if you want to look at it in advance:

 5. [Lab 1 problem sheet](ProblemSheet-Week1.md)

Each lab session will start with a 10 minute explanation of the activities you have to perform in the lab. There will be demonstrators to help you.

## Additional material

 6. Chapter 1 of the book [Programming in Haskell](https://bham.rl.talis.com/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridge.org%2Fhighereducation%2Fbooks%2Fprogramming-in-haskell%2F8FED82E807EF12D390DE0D16FDE217E4%23contents&sig=2a624bac8cc1623f3e311b0fa1c2f1c586cd6b257065ab469d51412294038c39)
