# Activity Plan for Week 2

This week involves an anticipated time commitment of 12 total hours of structured and self-directed activity, where 3 of them are a lecture and a lab session.

## Summary

In Week 2 of the Functional Programming module, we will:

 * Study the basic `Type Classes` and `Instances`.

 * Understand different ways of writing `Functions` (composing, guarded equations, pattern matching, and lambda  expressions).

 * Look at `Operators` and `Sections`: ways to turn infix function symbols into functions.

 * Apply our knowledge on functions when learning a bit more on `Type Classes`.

## Make sure you have completed the Activity Plan for Week 1

You must:

 1. Make sure you have done the [problem sheet for Week 1](ProblemSheet-Week1.md).

 2. Make sure you have done all the [required reading for Week 1](activity-plan-week01.md).

## Required reading for this week

You must read the following handouts:

 3. [Type Classes and Instances](typeclasses.md)

 4. [Functions](functions.md)

 5. [More on Type Classes](more-typeclasses.md)

 6. [Even more about type classes](even-more-typeclasses.md)

We suggest that you read two handouts before the lecture, and the remaining two after the lecture.

## Additional reading

To reinforce your understanding or clarify doubts about the handouts, you may wish to read one or more of the following.

 7. Chapter 3 of [Programming in Haskell](https://rl.talis.com/3/bham/lists/D8A4E97C-76C1-121A-7100-E513B9C6B342.html?lang=en).

 8. Chapter 3 of [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/types-and-typeclasses.html#typeclasses-101)

 9. Chapter 2 of [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/types-and-functions.html).

## Attend lecture

## Attend a lab session

You will work on [Problem Sheet 2](ProblemSheet-Week2.md)

## Complete homework

The homework is included at the end of the above problem sheet. You should aim to complete it before the lecture on Week 3.

## Sample solutions

Sample solutions will be available [here](solutions) after you complete your lab problem sheet and homework.
