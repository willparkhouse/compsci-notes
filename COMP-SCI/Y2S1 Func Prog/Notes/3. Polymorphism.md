Some functions act on elements of **different types**, which allows for code reuse. This is known as **polymorphism**. A polymorphic function is a function whose type contains **type variables**. When applying a polymorphic function to an input, the type variables are suitably **instantiated**.

**Example: the type family of lists**

Let's look at the datatype of lists:
```haskell
Prelude> :t ['a', 'b', 'c']   -- a list of characters
['a', 'b', 'c'] :: [Char]

Prelude> :t [False, True, True, True]   -- a list of Booleans
[False, True, True, True] :: [Bool]

Prelude> :t ["foo", "bar"]   -- a list of lists of characters, aka, a list of strings
["foo", "bar"] :: [[Char]]
```
For any type `a`, we can form the type `[a]`. Its elements are lists of elements of type `a`.

There are two ways of creating a list:
	1. The empty list is a list `[]`
	2. To a given list `xs` we can prepend an element `x`, written `x:xs`

Firstly, for any type `a`, there is the empty list of elements of `a`:
```haskell
Prelude> :t []
[] :: [a]
```
Here, `a` in `[] :: [a]` is a **type variable**, which can be instantiated with any type. For instance, `a` can be set to be `Integer`, the type of integer numbers in GHC:
```haskell
Prelude> :t [] :: [Integer]
[] :: [Integer] :: [Integer]
```
In this example, we did not use **type _inference_**, but instead **type _checking_**: we suggest to `ghci` that `[]` should have type `[Integer]`, and ask `ghci` to confirm, which it does.
Similarly, `ghci` is happy to confirm that `[]` has type `[Char]`:
```haskell
Prelude> :t [] :: [Char]
[] :: [Char] :: [Char]
```


There is also a way to build a new list from a smaller one, by adding a new element at the beginning:
```haskell
Prelude> :t (:)
(:) :: a -> [a] -> [a]
```
We can evaluate the expression `False:[True, False]`:
```haskell
Prelude> False:[True, False]
[False,True,False]
```

It is **crucial** that in the expression `x:xs`, that `x` and `xs` are of the same type.

A function whose type contains **one** or **more** type variables is **polymorphic**. The functions `[]` and `(:)` are examples of polymorphic functions.

Here is an example of a function whose type contains **two** type variables:
```haskell
Prelude> :t zip
zip :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]
```
