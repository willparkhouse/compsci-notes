We can use a truth table to prove equivilence of two formulas:

Here are two important forms of formulas to know, CNF and DNF:
**Conjunctive Normal forms** (CNF)  
![[chrome_FMlqzRPhjC.jpg]]
ANDs of ORs of literals (atoms or negations of atoms)  
A clause in this context is a disjunction of literals  
**Every formula can be expressed in CNF**

**Disjunctive Normal Form** (DNF)

ORs of ANDs of literals  
A clause in this context is a conjunction of literals
**Every proposition can be expressed in DNF**
