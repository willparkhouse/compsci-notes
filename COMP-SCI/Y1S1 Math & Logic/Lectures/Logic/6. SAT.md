SAT is CNF Satisfiability. 
Problem definition: Given a CNF formula can we set T or F value to each variable to satisfy the formula?

***P* and *NP* Problems**
*P*: the class of problems which we can solve in polynomial time.
*NP*: class of problems where we can verify a potential solution in polynomial time.

Clearly P is a subset of NP, BUT we don't know if P = NP. Most people believe it is not.
It's difficult to prove as we can't easily rule out all polynomial time algorithms.

**DNF Satisfiability**
DNF Satisfiability is relatively easy, and can be solved in polynomial time BUT when we convert from a CNF to a DNF we can cause an exponential blowup of clauses.

**Algorithms for SAT**
We can brute force SAT. For N variables and M clauses, we need $2^N$ * N * M time.

Many SAT solvers are based on the **Davis-Putman-Logemann-Loveland** algorithm (DPLL).
