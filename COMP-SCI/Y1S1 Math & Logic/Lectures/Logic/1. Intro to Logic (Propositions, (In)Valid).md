**Intro to Logic**

A **proposition** is a sentence that states a fact.
IE a statement that can be true or false
EG 
	Birmingham is north of london
	8 * 7 = 42

An **argument** is a list of propositions
	-the last of which is called the conclusion
	-and the others are called premises

An argument is **valid** if (and only if), whenever the premises are true, then so is the conclusion.
EG
	Premise 1: If there is smoke, then there is a fire
	Premise 2: There is no fire
	Conclusion: Therefore, there is no smoke.
This argument is **valid**.

INVALID argument:
1.If P then Q
2.Q
3.Therefore, P

Valid argument would be:
1.If P then Q
2.not Q
3.Therefore, P
