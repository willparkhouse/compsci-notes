Propositional logic allows us to state facts, but does not allow stating properties of and relations between “objects”. e.g. the property of numbers of being even, or odd.
This brings us to a **richer** logic called predicate logic 
- **contains propositional logic** 
- Predicate Logic is also known as **first-order logic** 
- Predicate logic allows us to reason about members of a (non-empty) domain

The key ingredients of predicate logic are:                  Examples of Predicate Logic Formulas // Arity

The **syntax** of predicate logic is defined by the following **grammar**:
$t::= x \quad | \quad f(x, ...,t)$
$P ::= p(t,...,t)\quad |\quad \neg P \quad | \quad P\quad \land P \quad |\quad P \quad \lor \quad P \quad | \quad P  \implies P \quad | \quad \forall x.P \quad | \quad \exists x .P$
where:
	$x$ ranges over **variables**
	$f$ ranges over **function** symbols
	$f(t_1, ...,t_n)$ is a well-formed term only if $f$ has arity $n$
	$p$ ranges over **predicate** symbols
	$p(t_1,...,t_n)$ is a well-formed formula only if $p$ has arity $n$

**Can you give an example of a signature ??***
