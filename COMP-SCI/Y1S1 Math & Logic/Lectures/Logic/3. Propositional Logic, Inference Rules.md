Propositional logic is a symbolic logic to reason about logical statements called propositions that can be true or false. 
Propositions are built by combining atomic propositions using `and, or, and` and ` implies`.
An argument is a list of propositions, the last of which is called the conclusion and the rest are premises. An argument is valid if and only if (iff) whenever the premises are true, then so is the conclusion.

The symbols used for propositional logic are show below :

and the BNF grammar is defined below:

NOTE: the OR is an inclusive OR, one or both.
With implication, the first term is the antecedent, and the second term is the consequent.

For formal proofs we need two things: 
	-A **formal language**
		used to represent propositions, arguments
	-A **proof theory**
		to prove whether an argument is valid
		E.G. natural deduction is a proof theory

**Natural Deduction** 
	-“natural” style of constructing a proof (like a human would) 
	-syntactic (rather than semantic) proof method 
	-proofs are constructed by applying inference rules 
Basic idea to prove an argument is valid: 
	-start with the premises (we can assume these are true)
	-repeatedly apply inference rules (which “preserve truth”)
	-until we have inferred the conclusion

**Inference Rules**
Inference rules are the tools we have/are allowed to use:
Example of an inference rule:

**NOTATION**
	Premise(s) at the top
	Conclusion at the bottom
	Name of the inference rule on the right in [ ] brackets
