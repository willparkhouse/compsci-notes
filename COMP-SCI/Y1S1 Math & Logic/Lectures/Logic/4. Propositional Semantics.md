2Syntax dictates rules for allowable formulas in the language
Semantics assigns meanings / interpretation with formulas

The basic notion is that of a **truth value**, either true or false.
This is a **classical** notion of truth:
	The law of excluded middle, for each A we have A V !A

A **truth assignment** is a function that assigns a truth value to an atomic proposition.
We often use ϕ, phi, such as ϕ(p) = T and ϕ(q) = F.
For these two atomic proposition we have 4 different permutations, 2^2.

For compound formulae, we work recursively bottom-up to determine the truth values up the tree.

With implication we have 4 permutations of truth. phi of an implication is only false if the premise is true and conclusion false, otherwise it is true.

Given a valuation ϕ on all atomic propositions, we say that ϕ satisfies A if ϕ(A) = T.

A formula is **satisfiable** is we can pick at **least one** permutation of phi that is true.

A formula is **valid** if phi is true for **ALL possible valuations of phi**.

We can use truth tables to check satisfiability and validity.

A formula is **satisfiable** iff there is a valuation that satisfies it i.e., if there is a **T** in the rightmost column of its truth table

A formula is **falsifiable** iff there is a valuation that makes it false i.e., if there is a **F** in the rightmost column of its truth table

A formula is **unsatisfiable** iff no valuation satisfies it i.e., the cells of the rightmost column of its truth table all contain **F** 

A formula is **valid** iff every valuation satisfies it i.e., the cells of the rightmost column of its truth table all contain **T**

**Validity of an arugment**
	-Syntactically: we can derive the conclusion from the premises
	-Semantically: the conclusion is true whenever the premises are

Formally we write:  $P_{1},...,P_{n}|= C$ if every corresponding argument is semantically valid.

Given a deduction system such as Natural deduction, a formula is said to be **provable** if there is a proof of it in that deduction system 
	§ This is a syntactic notion 
	§ it asserts the existence of a syntactic object: a proof 
	§ typically written $\vdash$A 
A formula, A, is **valid** if ϕ(A) = T for all possible valuations ϕ 
	§ it is a semantic notion 
	§ it is checked w.r.t. valuations that give meaning to formulas 
**Soundness**: a deduction system is sound w.r.t. a semantics if every provable formula is valid 
	§ i.e., if $\vdash$ A then $\vDash$ A 
**Completeness**: a deduction system is complete w.r.t. a semantics if every valid formula is provable 
	§ i.e., if  $\vDash$ A then $\vdash$ A
