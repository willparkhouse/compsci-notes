**Symbolic Logic**

Symbolic logics are formal languages that allow conducting logical reasoning through the manipulation of symbols.
	“Symbolic logic is the development of the most general principles of rational procedure, in ideographic symbols, and in a form which exhibits the connection of these principles one with another.” (Irving Lewis in A Survey of Symbolic Logic)

**Grammars**

The language of a symbolic logic is defined by a **grammar** that allows deriving formulas from collections of symbols. The grammar of such a language is often defined using a **Backus Naur Form (BNF**). BNFs allow defining context-free grammars (i.e., where production rules are context independent). They are collections of rules of the form:

This means that the LHS can expand to any of the forms rhs 1 to rhs n.

The **arity** of a terminal symbol is the number of arguments it takes.

The **Fixity** of a terminal symbol is the place where it occurs w.r.t. its arguments: infix if it occurs in-between its arguments, prefix if it occurs before, and postfix if it occurs after.

The example above translates to plain text as:
	An expression can take either a sequence of digits OR an addition OR a multiplication.

When we define a language, it is useful to specify associativity and precedence. eg ![[chrome_gck6LS18i0.jpg]]

Usually it's useful to use parentheses to remove ambiguity.

**(Meta)variables** 

Metavariables are non-terminals, like exp and P, with values ranging over all possible expressions / formulas. 
EG if I wanted to define `a * (b + c)` in a BNF, you could write `exp * (exp + exp) = expexp + expexp` but each of these `exp` metavariables are indistinguishable.
It is sometimes useful to distinct these, usually using subscripts. 

**Axiom Schemata**
An **axiom schemata** is a way for defining axioms using non-terminals. For example, `exp + 0 = exp` is an axiom schemata. It has infinite many axioms that can be instantiated by replacing `exp` with any arithmetic expression.

**Substitution**

How do we obtain the equality: `1 + 0 = 1` from the axiom schema:  `exp + 0 = exp`. We can substitute in `1` for `exp`. This is formally done by declaring `exp\1` or `exp1\0`.
A **substitution** is a mapping, that maps metavariables to arithmetic operations.
A **substitution operation** is the operation that replaces all occurrences of the keys by the corresponding values.![[chrome_QoclZ6hZgL.png]]
