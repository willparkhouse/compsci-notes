We can define a vector space as a set of vectors, V, an associated field, F, and two operations, +$_v$ and x$_v$.
Where +$_v$ and x$_v$ are distinct from the +$_f$ and x$_f$, used to operate on fields.

	For a vector space to be over a field, say $\mathbb{R}^n$ over $\mathbb{R}$, this only holds if scalar multiplication of $f\in\mathbb{F}$, $\vec{v}\in\mathbb{V}$ results in a valid vector in that vector space. So, if we had $\mathbb{R}^n$ as our vector space, and $\mathbb{C}$ as our field, a scalar multiplication of a complex number * a vector in the reals, would result in a vector in the complex vector space, as so would be invalid.
**Every field is a vector space over itself.**



**the set of n-tuples of rational numbers is a vector space over the rational numbers???? are we talking n-dimensional vectors, over an n-dimensional space?**
