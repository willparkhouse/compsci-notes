**Lists, Streams and Powerset**
Given a set A, we can obtain some more sets.  
• $A^*$ is the set of all lists of elements of A. For example, $\mathbb{N}^*$ is the set of all lists of natural numbers, such as \[6,2,6,7] or \[5,6,3,2,8]. For example, if A is the set of characters, then $A^*$ is the set of all strings.  
• $A^\omega$ is the set of all streams (infinite sequences) of elements of A. For example, $A^\omega$ is the set of all streams of natural numbers, such as  1,4,9,16,...  or  3,3,2,4,4,3,5,5,4,...  
For example, the decimal representation of π after the point is the stream 1,4,1,5,9,.... This belongs to the set  \[0 ..10)$^\omega$.
• $\mathcal{P}$A is the set of all subsets of A. This is called the powerset of A. For example, $\mathcal{P}$N is the set of all sets of natural numbers, such as {13,15,29}and {4,6,8,10,...}.

**Operations on Sets**
Let X be a set, e.g., the set of all people in the world. Then we have several operations on $\mathcal{P}$X. Firstly, for any subsets A and B, we have subsets A ∪ B and A ∩ B. Secondly, for each subset A, we define its complement (relative to X)  as follows:  ![[chrome_n1u5jg4xnj.jpg]]

The laws above have equivalents with logic notation, ∨ for “or”, ∧ for “and”, and ¬ for “not”
∅ is false and the ambient (or universal) set X (or epsilon) for True.

**Boolean Algebras**
Any set that’s equipped with operations ∨, ∧, and ¬, and constants false and true, and  
satisfies these laws, is called a boolean algebra. Thus, every powerset can be viewed as a boolean algebra. Note: Often for boolean algebras we use the logical notation.
