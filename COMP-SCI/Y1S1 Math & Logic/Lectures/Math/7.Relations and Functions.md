A **relation** R is a mapping from elements of one set. The domain of one set maps to the codomain of another.

Relations can be n-ary, e.g. AxBxC returns a set of ternary tuples.
The composition of relations 𝑅 ⊆ 𝐴 × 𝐵 and relation 𝑆 ⊆ 𝐵 × 𝐶 is denoted 𝑆 ∘ 𝑅 and is defined as:
**𝑆 ∘ 𝑅 = {(𝑥, 𝑧) |∃𝑦 ∈ 𝐵: (𝑥, 𝑦) ∈ 𝑅 ∧ (𝑦, 𝑧) ∈ 𝑆}**

**Functions**
Functions are a type of relation that follows some constraints. 

A function 𝑓 from a set 𝐴 to a set 𝐵 is an assignment of exactly one element of **b ∈ 𝐵** to each element of **a ∈ 𝐴**. We write, **𝑓(𝑎) = 𝑏** or **𝑓: 𝑎 ↦ 𝑏** if 𝑏 is the unique element of 𝐵 assigned by the function 𝑓 to the element 𝑎 of 𝐴. 
If 𝑓 is a function from 𝐴 to 𝐵, we write 𝑓: 𝐴→B

A relation must fulfill two conditions to qualify as a function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵. 
1. It must be single-valued, i.e., it must map each input to at most one image b ∈ 𝐵. 
2. It must be total, i.e., it must map each possible input to at least one image b ∈ 𝐵
Taken together, 1 and 2 mean each value 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 must be mapped to exactly one value 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵.

If A has size m, and B has size n, then there are n^m functions from A to B. We can write $A^B$ to denote the set of all functions that map A to B.

f: A -> B is another notation for a function that maps A to B. ///  A is domain, B is codomain. 

An endorelation on a set A is a relation from A to A.
An endofunction on a set A is a function from A to A.
Given a relation R, from A to B, and S, from B to C, we get the composite relation S∘R (note function style notation of this.)
The same is said for functions, think g( f ( x ) ).

Given a relation R from A to B:
	the converse relation R ^o  goes from B to A.
	Any subset X of A has a forwards image R\[X].
	Any subset Y of B has an inverse image R^-1\[Y]

**Functions**
If a function, f: A -> B, is said to be injective (one-to-one), iff:
![[chrome_1XzjgxIhYp.jpg]]
(If the gradient is ever zero then it is not injective.)
Given two finite sets A and B, there is an injection from A to B, iff the cardinality of **A\<B.**


If a function f: A -> B, is said to surjective (onto), iff:


If a function f: A -> B, is said to be bijective if and only if it is both one-one (injective) and onto.

Inverse functions, $f^{-1}$ (b) = a only if f(a) = b. Functions only have an inverse if they are bijective.

**Endorelations / Endofunctions**
An endorelation is a relation that maps a set `A` onto itself, and an endofunction is a function that maps a set `A` to itself. 
An endorelation in which **every** element `x` is related to itself (loops) is **reflexive**.
An endorelation in which **no** element `x` is related to itself (loops) is **irreflexive**.
An endorelation in which, if `x` and `y` are mutually related implies that `x = y`, is **antisymmetric**.
An endorelation in which if `x` is related to `y`, and `y` is to `z`, then `x` is related to `z` is **transitive**.

If an endofunction is reflexive, symmetric and transitive, then it is an **equivalence relation**.

You can represent a relation in a few different ways:
	-As a directed graph
	-As two sets, the domain and relation (edge) sets
	-As an adjacency matrix
A directed graph (or digraph) (V, R) consists of a nonempty set of vertices V and a set of directed edges (or arcs) R. Each edge is associated with an ordered pair of vertices.

Let *e* be an edge in a directed graph that is (*u, v*), then we say:
	*u* is **adjacent to** *v*, *v* is **adjacent from** *u*
	*e* **comes from** *u*, *e* **goes to** *v*
	*e* connects *u* to *v*, *e* goes from *u* to *v*
	The initial vertex of *e* is *u*
	The terminal vertex of *e* is *v*

The **In-Degree** of a vertex, $deg^-$(v), is the number of edges going to *v*.
The **Out-Degree** of a vertex, $deg^+$(v), is the number of edges coming from *v*.
The degree of a vertex is the sum of the in-degree and out-degree.

**Equivalence Classes**
When we have an equivalence relation, $\equiv$, on a set A, each element x has an **equivalence class** - the set of all elements equivalent to it.
$[x]_\equiv\equiv$  {y $\in$ A | x $\equiv$ y}
$[x]_\equiv$ is the equivalence class for the element $x$.

Also, this means that $x \in [x]_\equiv$ AND $x \equiv y \implies [x]_\equiv = [y]_\equiv$ BUT $x \not\equiv y \implies ([x]_\equiv\land[y]_\equiv = \emptyset)$
Colloquially this means that x is always a subset of its equivalence class, if x and y are equivalent then they have the same equivalence class, BUT if x and y are not equivalent, this  implies that there is no overlap between the two equivalence classes.

**Partition**
The set of sets: $\beta = {B_1, B_2, B_3, ... , B_N}$ forms a partition of a set A if:
	1. $A = B_1 \cup B_2 \cup ... \cup  B_N$ 
	2. $B_i \cap B_j = \emptyset, i \neq j$ 
Note that the number of sets in a partition does not necessarily have to be finite. 

Equivalence realation, $\equiv$, on A gives a partition, A/$\equiv$, on A.
Conversely, any partition $\beta$ on $A$ gives an equivalence relation.
Two elements of $A$ are related when the belong to the same member $B_i \in \beta$
There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between equivalence relations on A and partitions of A.

**Kernel**
For a function $f: A \implies B$, its kernel is the equivalence relation on A, that relates two elements with the same image.
The kernel of a function $f$ if denoted as ker($f$). Then we hava a correspondence between
A/ ker($f$) and the range of the $f$

**Orders**
An order on A is a relation that is **reflexive**, **transitive** and **antisymmetric**. An example of this could be a relation on a set A, such that x $\le$ y, for x and y in that set. 
A partial order is a relation that is **transitive**, **antisymmetric** but **not reflexive**. An example of this could be a relation on a set A, such that x < y, for x and y in that set. 

**Linear Orders** 
Given a relation R on A, we say that two elements, x and y, are **comparable** when either:
	x = y
	or (x, y) $\in$ R
	or (y, x) $\in$ R
A **linear order** is an order where **any** two elements are **comparable**.
