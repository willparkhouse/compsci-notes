A set is a collection of elements.

**Cardinality**
Finite sets have cardinality, which is a measure of size (number of distinct elements of the set). See below some finite and infinite sets. '..' denotes integer range, ',' denotes real number sets including the fractions, and thus is always infinite.

The notation for cardinality is |SET|, similar to the abs value. So for example:
|{5,6,8,7,7}| = 4 (as there is 4 distinct elements). 
NOTE: the empty sets ∅ has no elements, and 0 cardinality, but {∅}, has one element and cardinality 1.

**Subset**
![[MicrosoftWhiteboard_IgdvHgaFgE.jpg]]
A = B if and only if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A.
**Union, intersection and difference**
Given two sets A and B, we obtain some more sets. 
1. A ∪ B is the union. It consists of all things that are in either A or B. 
2. A ∩ B is the intersection. It consists of all things that are in both A and B. 
3. A \ B is the set-difference. It consists of all things that are in A but not B.
**Set-builder Notation**
{n∈N | n^3 > 100} is the notation for the set of natural numbers that's cubes are larger than 100, therefore \[5 .. ∞).
{n 2 | n∈N, n^3 > 100} is the set of squares of all natural numbers such that 
n^3 > 100. It is {25, 36, 49, . . .}.

**Tuples**
Tuples are ordered combinations, like an ordered pair, or ordered triple. We can think of this as a key/value pair. The basic property of ordered pairs is that 
(a, b) = (x, y) iff a = x and b = y.

**Repetitions![[chrome_UJOYJMEbO0.jpg]]**
If A is a finite set of *n* elements, then any list of its elements that has length n+1 must have a repetition. This is called the **pigeonhole principle**. 
This means, any set *A* is either infinite or finite with size at least *m* iff there is a list of m elements with no repetition.
