See below an easy way to convert to different bases using long division and remainders:

For a list of numbers L, its sum is written ∑L, and its product ∏L. 
		∑[3, 4, 8] = 15
		∑[] = 0 
		∏[3, 4, 8] = 96
		∏[] = 1 (You can think of this as the set of nothing having 1 result and the above result being the choices presented with a choice of 3, then 4, then 8)

A commutative ring is a set that satisfies two binary operations, AND has an additive inverse. A commutative **semi**-ring does satisfy two binary operators, but does NOT have an additive inverse (no way to a + (-a) = 0 )

DIGRESSION: `div` and `mod` are integer division and remainder method respectively.
```
123 div 10 = 12
123 mod 10 = 3
58.7 div 10 = 5
58.7 mod 10 = 8.7
```
Note that `a div b` is always an integer and 0 ≤ `a mod b` < 10 such that:
`(a div b) * b + (a mod b) = a`
Consequently:
```
-7  div 10 = -1
-7 mod 10 = 3
-123 div 10 = -13
-123 mod 10 = 7
```


There are two ways to represent an integer on paper. One is the sign-and-magnitude notation, e.g. +623 or −127. For a nonzero integer, we first we give the sign + or −, and then the magnitude, which is a positive natural number. Note: zero is a special case, since +0 = −0

The other is complement notation, in a given base. Let’s consider base ten. +623 is written as ̇0623, where the ̇0 is short for . . . 000. Likewise 0 is represented as ̇0. What about −127? Let’s do a subtraction:

**Coprime Numbers**
Two positive natural numbers are coprime when their largest common factor is 1.
	8 and 31 are coprime
	8 and 30 are NOT coprime
This is an important concept for cycles.


Rational numbers can be written as a/b, where a & b are coprime.
The symbol is as below:
![set rational](https://www.mathsisfun.com/images/symbols/set-q.svg)
**Q** is the set of rational numbers, it can add, subtract, and multiply - it's a commutative ring.
**Q** is also a **field**, which is a commutative ring with **multiplicative inverses**.
In a field, we have the multiplicative cancellation law:
	a * x = a * y  AND a does not equal 0
	therefore:  x = y

The real numbers are non-imaginary numbers, symbol as shown below:
![set real](https://www.mathsisfun.com/images/symbols/set-r.svg)
The set of real number forms a **field**.

**Radix point // Floor/Ceiling Notation // Scientific Notation**

As we have seen scientific notation is a precise way to represent every positive real number. But it has two practical limitations:  
• The mantissa has infinitely many digits after the point.  
• The exponent can be a very large or very small integer.  
Accordingly, to represent positive real numbers in memory, we make two compromises:  
• We round the mantissa to a fixed number of digits.  
• We restrict the exponent to a fixed range of integers.

Say we wish to represent a floating number in 16 bits, we use the first 8 bits to represent the mantissa and the last 8 bits to represent the exponent. 
For example the number 1011 0010 1101 0110 in float point is:

The mantissa is 1011 0010 is equal to 2^(0) + 2^(−1) + 2^(−3) + 2^(−4) + 2^(−7) which equals 1 & 89/128.

The exponent 11010110 - 128 which equals 64 + 16 + 4 + 1 = 89.

So the number is ![[chrome_ETZWXnx6og.jpg]].
