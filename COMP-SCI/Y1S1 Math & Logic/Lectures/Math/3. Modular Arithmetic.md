100528 and 738928 are congruent modulo 100.
If we have:
	a ≡ x (mod n)  
	b ≡ y (mod n)
Then :
	a + b ≡ x + y (mod n)  
	a − b ≡ x − y (mod n)  
	a * b ≡ x * y (mod n)

These rules form a commutative ring,![[chrome_yQKmz1Ks2o.jpg]], the commutative ring of arithmetic
modulo 10. These rules satisfy the commutative laws, associative laws and additive inverse laws.

For integers A and B:

In the commutative ring, Z (sub m), a number x has a multiplicative inverse iff it is coprime with m.

Z (sub m) is a field, iff m is prime, otherwise there will be a number that does not have a multiplicative inverse.
