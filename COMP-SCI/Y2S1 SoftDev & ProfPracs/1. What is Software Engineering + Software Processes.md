Software Engineering is a branch of systems engineering concerned with the development of large and complex software intensive systems. It focuses on:
– the real-world goals for, services provided by, and constraints on such systems,
– the precise specification of systems structure and behaviour, and the implementations of these specifications,
– the activities required in order to develop an assurance that the specifications and real world-world goals have been met,
– the evolution of these systems over time, and across systems families,
– It is also concerned with the processes, methods and tools for the development of software intensive systems in an economic and timely manner.

A software process model is an abstract representation of a process. It presents a description of a process from some particular perspective.

There is an often used structured set of activities required to develop a software system:
– Specification;  
– Design;  
– Validation;  
– Evolution.

An example of a software process is the **waterfall model**.

In phase 1, we establish what services and required and the constraints on the system's operator and development. "What is the system about?". A formalised model of this phase could include:
	-Feasibility Study
	-Requirements elicitation and analysis
	-Requirements specification
	-Requirements validation

In phase 2, we plan *how* the requirements are to be realised, by designing a suitable software structure. A formalised model of this includes:
	-Architectural design  
	-Abstract specification  
	-Interface design  
	-Component design  
	-Data structure design  
	-Algorithm design.....

In phase 3, we implement subsystems and unit tests:
Implementation: Executable code
Unit testing (Component test):
	Individual components (function/programs/classes) are tested independently; 
	Components may be functions or objects or coherent groupings of these entities. 

In phase 4 we integrate the subsystems together and test the system as a whole:
–System testing
	Integration Testing of the units and system as a whole.
	Testing of emergent properties is particularly important (e.g. performance, security, etc)
–Acceptance testing 
	Test with customer data to check that the system meets the customer’s needs.

Phase 5:Operation and maintenance
–Deployment of the software
–Continuous testing and maintenance triggered by the community
–Trigger for software evolution:
	New features, evolved versions


The waterfall method is a very linear technique, which has some pitfalls for rapid development. More commonly used is **evolutionary development** which involves:
•Exploratory development
	–Objective is to work with customers and to evolve a final system from an initial outline specification.
	–Start with well-understood requirements and add new features as proposed by the customer (i.e. incremental)
•Throw-away prototyping
	–Objective is to understand the system requirements. Should start with poorly understood requirements to clarify what is really needed.
	
System requirements ALWAYS evolve in the course of a project, so process iteration where earlier stages are reworked is always part of the process for large systems. Two (related) approaches are **incremental delivery** and **spiral development**.

**Incremental delivery**
Rather than deliver the system as a single delivery, the development and delivery is broken down into increments, with each increment delivering part of the required functionality (i.e., Agile practices). User requirements are prioritized, the highest priority requirements are included in early increments. Once the development of an increment is started, the requirements are frozen, though requirements for later increments can continue to evolve. Early increments act as a prototype to help elicit requirements for later increments.
	•Lower risk of overall project failure
	•The highest priority system services tend to receive the most testing
	•Customer value can be delivered with each increment so system functionality is available earlier

**Spiral Development**
•Process is represented as a spiral rather than as a sequence of activities with backtracking
•Each loop in the spiral represents a phase in the process
•No fixed phases such as specification or design - loops in the spiral are chosen depending on what is required.
•Risks are explicitly assessed and resolved throughout the process
•Several prototypes are built as part of the process
