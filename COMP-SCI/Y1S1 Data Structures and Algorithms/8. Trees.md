Trees are a very powerful data structure.

Trees are comprised of nodes with **children**, connected by a link called an **edge**.
The top node is the **root** node. 
A node with no children is a **leaf**.
Each **child** node has **one** parent.
In the above example: 
	1 has **ancestors** 30 and 33 
	33 has **descendants** 10, 30, 21 and 1.
The **size** of a tree is the number of non-zero nodes, an empty tree has size **0**. 
The **height** of the tree is its depth (3 for example above), an empty tree has height **-1**.
**Unary** trees are linked lists (referred to as linked lists, not trees). 
**Binary** tree's nodes have two children, **ternary** have three, **quad** trees have four.
A **path** is a sequence of connected edges between two nodes.
Trees have the property that there is **exactly one** path between the root and each node.

There are 3 common approaches to implement trees:
	1. Basic - a linked list with pointers to each of the children of that node. For binary trees, we have two pointers, left child and right child.
	2. Sibling list - a linked list with a pointer to the node's child, then to the node's siblings. These are good for trees with variable number of children, as you don't require each node to have `n` children, where `n` is the number of most children for any node in the tree. EG say a node in a tree has 8 children, with sibling lists, each of the nodes doesn't require 8 pointers.
	3. Array - For binary trees, use arrays with a layout based on storing the root at index 1, then the children of the node at index `i` is stored at index `2 ∗ i` and `(2 ∗ i) + 1`.
