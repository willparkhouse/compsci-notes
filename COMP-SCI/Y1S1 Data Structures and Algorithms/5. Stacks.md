**Stacks**

A stack is an ADT defined by its three operations:
	`push(x)` puts a value `x` on top of the stack.
	`pop(x)` takes out a value from the top of the stack (if empty throws exception)
	`is_empty()` says whether the stack is empty

Diagrammatic view of a stack:

A stack can only be edited from the elements at top of the stack first. This is what we call a "Last In First Out (LIFO)" manner. Stacks can hold any data type, ints, strings, bools.

Here is a possible list of operations for a Stack ADT:
	`EmptyStack`: returns an empty Stack
	`push(element, stack)`: pushes an element to the top of the given stack
	`top(stack)`: returns the value at the top of the stack without changing it
	`pop(stack)`: returns the stack with the top element removed
	`isEmpty(stack)`: reports whether the stack is empty

You can implement a stack with a linked list:

If using a linked list, we take:
	`push` = `insert_beg`
	`pop` = `delete_beg` 
	`is_empty` = `is_empty`

We use the beginning of the linked list to avoid traversing the linked list each time we wish to add or remove an element from the stack. Pop and push are of constant time.

Stacks are also often implemented with arrays:

This can be implemented by:
```
stack = new int[MAXSTACK];
stack_size = 0;
```
Here, the bottom of the stack is at index 0 and the top of the stack is at `stack_size -1`.
Push and pop are both of constant time.

Storing stacks as arrays has the advantage that we avoid calling allocate memory all the time (this takes time, even if it is done automatically for us, like in Java). On the other hand, we need to know the maximum size of the stack in advance.

NOTE: In Java we usually use the Deque<...> class which implements the Stack ADT but with both ends accessible, and which grows as the stack increases in size.

**Reverse Polish Notation**
The most natural way of evaluating an expression written in reverse polish notation is by using stacks. For example, `5 - 3 * ((2 + 8) / 2 - 4)` is written as `5328+2/4-*-` in reverse polish notation. We can add each of the numbers to the stack and every time we encounter an operation we pop the last 2 numbers, apply the operation and then push the result to the stack. So:
|5|
|3|
|2|
|8| then 2+8 = 10, 10/2 = 5, then 5-4 = 1, then 3\*1=3, then 5-3=2.
